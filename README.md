## todo-app

A React.js app that maintains the user's personal *To-Do list*.

This is an introductory project I made while learning **React.js**

The *__To-Do__ app* has the following functionalities :
* *add a task* to the list 
* *delete an existing task* on the list
* *check and uncheck* the tasks (with visible changes in style)
* footer displays the *total number of tasks* present on the list which updates accordingly.
